Si's PHP Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple, fast and flexible framework for PHP 5.3+

SPF utilises the latest PHP 5.3 features, including namespaces, late static
binding and closures. It aims to enable the rapid development of web
applications by providing a set of pre-wired, common components that are easily
swappable depending on the needs of the project.

Each component of the framwork can be used stand-alone; great for quick
prototypes and proof-of-concepts.
